It can be used in many different ways and you can also customize it to use your own animations.  \n  \nUsage  \n----\n  \n**Navigation Controller Mode**  \n  \nIf you wish for `JVMenuPopover` to operate as a navigation controller then you will need to use sub-classes of `JVMenuViewController`   \n  \nThis will provide a menu button on each view controller from the menu and handle displaying and switching between views.  \n  \nTypically this will use a shared menu from `JVMenuPopoverConfig.SharedInstance.MenuItems`.  \n  \nThis method can be seen demonstrated in the `JVMenuPopoveNavigationSample`  \n  \n**Navigation Controller Mode**  \n  \nIf you would like `JVMenuPopover` to operate as simply a menu then you just need to add a `JVMenuPopoverViewController` object to your view controller and call the `ShowMenuFromController` method to display it.  \n  \nIf you want to have a different menu on each instance of `JVMenuPopoverViewController` you can pass a `List\u003cJVMenuItem\u003e` through as part of the constructor, or it can use a shared menu from `JVMenuPopoverConfig.SharedInstance.MenuItems` if you use the default constructor.   \n  \nThis method can be seen demonstrated in the `JVMenuPopoverMenuSample`  \n  \n**Defining a menu**  \n  \nThe API for the `JVMenuPopover` for Xamarin.iOS is different to the original API, in that it is now designed to be used as a library rather than compiled in to you application as source.  \n  \nAs such this means that it works differently.  \n  \nThe menu is made up of a list of `JVMenuItem` items, or rather sub-classes of `JVMenuItem`.  We provide two such classes(and a Generic version of one) to enable you to define both View Controllers and Actions in you menu.  \n  \n - `JVMenuActionItem`  \n  - Call an `Action` on the UI thread when the item is selected  \n - `JVMenuViewControllerItem` and `JVMenuViewControllerItem\u003cT\u003e`  \n  - Attach and show a view controller when the item is shown.  \n  - `JVMenuViewControllerItem\u003cT\u003e` can generate a new instance of the view controller each time the item is selected or keep a single instance of it\n\nBelow is an example of a shared menu definition using `JVMenuPopoverConfig.SharedInstance.MenuItems`  \n\t\n\t//build the shared menu\n\tJVMenuPopoverConfig.SharedInstance.MenuItems = new List\u003cJVMenuItem\u003e()\n\t{\n\t\tnew JVMenuViewControllerItem()\n\t\t{\n\t\t\t//New view controller, will be reused everytime the item is selected\n\t\t\tIcon = UIImage.FromBundle(@\"about-48\"),\n\t\t\tTitle = @\"About Us\",\n\t\t\tViewController = new JVMenuSecondController(),\n\t\t},\n\t\tnew JVMenuViewControllerItem\u003cJVMenuFifthController\u003e()\n\t\t{\n\t\t\t//New view controller, will be recreated afresh everytime the item is selected\n\t\t\tIcon = UIImage.FromBundle(@\"ask_question-48\"),\n\t\t\tTitle = @\"Help?\",\n\t\t\tAlwaysNew = true,\n\t\t},\n\t\tnew JVMenuActionItem()\n\t\t{\n\t\t\t//Action is called, on the UI thread, everytime the item is selected\n\t\t\tIcon = UIImage.FromBundle(@\"ask_question-48\"),\n\t\t\tTitle = @\"Logout\",\n\t\t\tCommand = ()=\u003e\n\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\tvar uiAlert = new UIAlertView(\"Logout\",\"Are you sure you want to log out?\",null,\"No\",\"Yes\");\n\t\t\t\tuiAlert.Show();\n\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t},\n\t};\n\n  \nYou can also pass the `List\u003cJVMenuItem\u003e` to the constructor of `JVMenuPopoverViewController` and `JVMenuViewController`  \n\n**Configuring the menu appearance** \n\n`JVMenuPopoverConfig` now has several new properties to configure the appearance of the menu.  This are.  \n\n- FontName   \n - Select the font type to use in the menu  \n- FontSize  \n - Select the size of the font  \n- RowHeight  \n - Provide the Height of the rows in the menu\u0027s tableview  \n- TintColor  \n - The Selected tint color for the icons(when using UIImageRenderingMode.AlwaysTemplate) and text  \n- MenuImage\n - The image to use for the menu toggle button\n- CancelImage\n - The image to use for the cancel button\n- DisableMenuImageTinting  \n  - Disable application of the tint color to the Menu Image\n- DisableCancelImageTinting  \n  - Disable application of the tint color to the Cancel Image  \n\nThese properties are all access from the singleton instance of the `JVMenuPopoverConfig` class, `JVMenuPopoverConfig.SharedInstance`  \n  \n  \nAttribution  \n----\n  \nThis component is a port to C# from the original Objective-C repo created by [Jorge Valbuena](https://github.com/JV17/JVMenuPopover)  \n\t\n\t\n \n\n","Hash":"dc3f1daa18a784f9e6723db21d99a660","TargetPlatforms":["ios"],"TrialHash":null}
