# JVMenuPopover  

This is a simple menu controller where I tried to simulate the native iOS animation of switching between apps. It can be used in many different ways and you can also customize it to use your own animations.

**Features**  

 - Ability to use as a navigation controller or popover menu
 - Assign View Controllers or Actions to menu Items
 - Used a static menu or a different menu on each View Controller
 - Configure Font Name and Size, Tint Color and Row Height, Images
